    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

      <p class="izquierda">
        By purchasing a commission, you indicate that you've read and agreed to these Terms of Service.<br><br>

        ◈ I reserve the right to deny any commission request for any given or undisclosed reason.<br><br>

        ◈ Completion time may range from a few days to several weeks depending on complexity and my workload.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please be patient, as this is not my main job and I can only dedicate a few hours a day to it.</span><br><br>

        ◈ You may ask for status/progress updates at any time.<br><br>

        ◈ Minor adjustments are allowed during the sketch stage. After approval, only color tweaks or very small edits may be requested.<br><br>

        ◈ No major changes will be made once the current stage has been approved.<br><br>

        ◈ Final art may be posted on my social media with lower resolution and compression. If you wish for your commission to remain private, this must be agreed on from the start. Once posted, no complaints will be accepted.<br><br>

        ◈ You may not claim the artwork as your own or remove my signature/watermark (you may ask for it to be placed more subtly).<br><br>

        ◈ You can post the art on your own social media, as long as you tag or credit me.<br><br>

        ◈ My art may not be used in AI datasets, for AI training, or as NFTs/blockchain-related content.<br><br>

        ◈ Commercial use (merchandise, prints, etc.) is not allowed unless discussed beforehand and a commercial fee is paid.<br><br>

        ◈ You may use your commission to make **personal** goodies like stickers, standees, dakimakuras, etc. (Feel free to ask if this part is unclear).

        ◈ Payment is full and upfront. Accepted methods: PayPal or bank transfer (Mexico only).<br><br>

        ◈ Full refunds are only possible *before* the sketch is approved. If refunded, the sketch will be used as a YCH and you forfeit rights to it.<br><br>

        ◈ No refunds will be issued once the final artwork is complete.<br><br>

        ◈ Prices may vary depending on the commission's complexity.<br><br>
